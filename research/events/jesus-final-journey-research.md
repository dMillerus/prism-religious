**Waypoints**: ~8-10 major locations
**Confidence Level**: HIGH (well-documented geography, archaeological sites confirmed)

---

## Biblical Foundation

### Primary Passage

**Luke 9:51-19:28**: The Travel Narrative
- "Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem" (Luke 9:51)
- Rejection in Samaria (Luke 9:52-56)
- Ministry through Samaria/Galilee border (Luke 17:11)
- Jericho: Blind beggar healed, Zacchaeus conversion (Luke 18:35-19:10)
- Approaching Jerusalem (Luke 19:11-28)

**Synoptic Parallels**:
- Matthew 19-20, Mark 10: Similar journey accounts
- John 11-12: Bethany visit, anointing, triumphal entry

### Route Description

Jesus' journey took an unusual path due to Samaritan rejection:

1. **Intended Route**: Galilee → Samaria → Judea (direct, ~80 miles)
2. **Actual Route**: Galilee → Perea (east of Jordan) → Judea (longer, ~100+ miles)

**Reason for Diversion**: Luke 9:53 - "the Samaritans did not receive him, because his face was set toward Jerusalem"

### Geographic Mentions Extracted

From Luke's Gospel and synoptic parallels:

1. **Capernaum** (Luke 9:51 context) - Starting point in Galilee
2. **Samaritan village** (Luke 9:52) - Rejection site (border region)
3. **Border of Samaria and Galilee** (Luke 17:11) - Ten lepers healed
4. **Perea** (implied, Matthew 19:1, Mark 10:1) - "Region beyond the Jordan"
5. **Jericho** (Luke 18:35, 19:1) - Blind beggar, Zacchaeus
6. **Bethany** (John 12:1) - Home of Lazarus, Mary, Martha; anointing
7. **Bethphage** (Luke 19:29) - Where disciples got the colt
8. **Mount of Olives** (Luke 19:29, 37) - Triumphal entry descent
9. **Jerusalem** (Luke 19:41, 45) - Final destination

## Historical Context

### Timeline & Dating

**Date**: Spring 30 AD (or 33 AD, scholarly debate)
**Duration**: ~1 week for final leg (Jericho → Jerusalem)
**Season**: Spring (Passover pilgrimage, late March/early April)
**Context**: Thousands of pilgrims traveling to Jerusalem for Passover

### Route Analysis

**Why the Perea Route?**
1. **Samaritan-Jewish hostility**: Jews commonly avoided Samaria when traveling to Jerusalem
2. **Pilgrimage tradition**: Standard route for Galilean pilgrims was via Perea
3. **Safety**: Traveling in groups along established paths
4. **Religious reasons**: Avoiding "unclean" Samaritan territory

**Historical Roads**:
- Jordan Valley road (eastern side of river, through Perea)
- Jericho-Jerusalem road (steep ascent, ~1,200m elevation gain)
- Mount of Olives approach to Jerusalem (eastern gate)

### Archaeological Evidence

**Confirmed Sites**:
- **Capernaum**: Extensive excavations, synagogue foundations, Peter's house
- **Jericho**: Tell es-Sultan (Old Testament), Herodian winter palaces nearby
- **Bethany**: Traditional tomb of Lazarus, excavations confirm 1st century occupation
- **Bethphage**: Franciscan church marks traditional site on Mount of Olives
- **Jerusalem**: Temple Mount, walls, gates well-documented

## Confidence Assessment

### Overall Confidence: HIGH

**Rationale**:
- All major waypoints archaeologically confirmed
- Route well-documented in synoptic Gospels
- First-century road systems known
- Standard pilgrimage path for Galilean Jews

### High Confidence Elements

1. **Capernaum as starting point** (Jesus' Galilean base of operations)
2. **Perea route** (standard Jewish pilgrimage path avoiding Samaria)
3. **Jericho** (specific events narrated: blind beggar, Zacchaeus)
4. **Bethany** (home of Lazarus, multiple Gospel references)
5. **Triumphal entry route** (Bethphage → Mount of Olives → Jerusalem)
6. **Archaeological sites** (all major locations excavated and confirmed)

### Medium Confidence Elements

1. **Exact Samaria border location** (general region, not specific village)
2. **Jordan crossing point** (general area, not precise location)
3. **Perea waypoints** (region, not specific towns - few mentioned in text)
4. **Intermediate coordinates** (approximated based on roads, not archaeological)

### Key Assumptions Documented

1. **Perea route chosen**: Based on Matthew 19:1, Mark 10:1, and Jewish travel customs
2. **Samaria rejection early**: Luke places it at journey start (9:52-56)
3. **One-week final leg**: Jericho → Jerusalem segment likely occurred in final week before Passover
4. **Mount of Olives approach**: Consistent with all four Gospels
