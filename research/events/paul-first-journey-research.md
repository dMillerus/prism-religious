Researcher: Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5)

## Executive Summary

Paul's First Missionary Journey (c. 46-48 AD) represents the beginning of Christianity's expansion beyond Jewish communities into the Gentile world. This research documents the curation of a geographically-accurate event tracing Paul and Barnabas's journey through Cyprus and Asia Minor (modern Turkey).

**Scope**: Antioch (Syria) → Cyprus → Southern Asia Minor → Return to Antioch
**Primary Passage**: Acts 13:1-14:28
**Waypoints**: ~12-14 locations (including return route)
**Confidence Level**: HIGH (Roman cities well-documented, roads known, sea routes established)

## Historical Context

### Timeline & Dating

**Date**: c. 46-48 AD (some scholars: 47-49 AD)
**Duration**: ~2 years total
**Season**: Likely spring departure (sailing season), multiple winters
**Context**: Roman Peace (Pax Romana), established road networks, safe Mediterranean travel

### Route Analysis

**Why This Route?**
1. **Cyprus first**: Barnabas's home (Acts 4:36), familiar territory, large Jewish population
2. **Asia Minor via Pamphylia**: Natural progression from Cyprus, Roman province of Galatia
3. **Via Sebaste road**: Roman road connecting Pisidian Antioch to Lystra and beyond
4. **Return through same cities**: Strengthen new believers, appoint elders (Acts 14:21-23)
5. **Attalia for return**: Shorter sea route than returning to Perga

**Historical Roads**:
- Via Sebaste: Major Roman road through Pisidia and Lycaonia
- Coastal road: Attalia to Perga to Side
- King's Road: Ancient route through Asia Minor
- Sea routes: Established Mediterranean shipping lanes

**Sea Routes**:
- Seleucia to Salamis: ~100 nautical miles, 1-2 days sailing
- Paphos to Perga: ~180 nautical miles, 2-3 days sailing
- Attalia to Seleucia: ~250 nautical miles, 3-4 days sailing

### Archaeological Evidence

**Confirmed Sites**:
- **Antioch (Syria)**: Ancient Antakya, extensive Roman ruins
- **Seleucia Pieria**: Port excavations at modern Samandağ
- **Salamis**: Major archaeological site on Cyprus, theater, gymnasium, basilica
- **Paphos**: UNESCO World Heritage site, Roman mosaics, proconsul's palace area
- **Perga**: Extensive excavations, theater, stadium, Roman gates
- **Pisidian Antioch**: Temple of Augustus, synagogue foundations (1st century building under Byzantine church)
- **Iconium**: Modern Konya, limited Roman-era remains but well-documented
- **Lystra**: Recent excavations at Zoldura Höyük, basilica discovered (2024)
- **Derbe**: Identified at Kerti Hüyük, inscription confirms city name
- **Attalia**: Modern Antalya, Hadrian's Gate, Roman harbor

## Confidence Assessment

### Overall Confidence: HIGH

**Rationale**:
- All major cities archaeologically confirmed and well-documented
- Roman road system (Via Sebaste) known and excavated
- Sea routes established Mediterranean shipping lanes
- Timeline fits Roman historical records (Sergius Paulus as proconsul c. 46-48 AD)

### High Confidence Elements

1. **All city locations** (10 sites with confirmed archaeological evidence)
2. **Via Sebaste road** (Roman road from Pisidian Antioch through Iconium, Lystra, to Derbe)
3. **Sea routes** (Established Mediterranean shipping lanes, prevailing winds known)
4. **Paphos conversion** (Sergius Paulus historically documented as proconsul)
5. **Return route** (Acts 14:21-25 explicitly states return through same cities)
6. **Attalia as departure port** (Logical choice, shorter sea route than Perga)

### Medium Confidence Elements

1. **Exact roads between Perga and Pisidian Antioch** (General route known, specific paths approximated)
2. **Duration of stays** (Not specified in Acts, estimated from narrative)
3. **Intermediate waypoints** (Approximated based on terrain and road systems)

### Key Assumptions Documented

1. **Via Sebaste as primary route**: Well-documented Roman road through Pisidia/Lycaonia
2. **Sea routes follow prevailing winds**: Spring/summer sailing, favorable westerlies for return
3. **Return visits brief**: Text emphasizes "strengthening disciples," not extended ministry
4. **Attalia chosen over Perga**: Shorter sea route, better harbor
5. **Cyprus traversal**: "Whole island" (Acts 13:6) implies coast-to-coast journey
